Glyph extension font axis demos

[Arabic kashida animation](https://jmsole.github.io/gext-demos/arvar-animation/): This is the first demos we created, before the proposal of the gext axis.

[GEXT axis demos with glyph handles](https://jmsole.github.io/gext-demos/gext-handles/): **THIS DEMO WORKS PROPERLY ONLY ON LATEST VERSIONS OF CHROME AND FIREFOX**: For this demo we've implemented a font with GEXT axis. We wanted to show how it could work for people to be able to apply the axis individually on each glyph and not have to rely on sliders. This is also the first step towards a full justification demo.
